KianKit 2 represents a return to our core values: **simplicity with extensibility**, **minimalism**, and **eradicating complexity**. With this release, I've focused on making sure that KianKit aligns closely with these guiding principles, delivering an experience that empowers you to build effectively while staying true to what matters most.

### Realigning with Our Principles

The goal of KianKit 2 is not just to add features but to realign the kit with its core purpose—helping developers create projects quickly, without unnecessary complexity. Here's how we're doing it:

- **Simplicity with Extensibility**: By providing pre-configured tools like authentication, SEO, and component actions, KianKit remains simple to use while still allowing for easy extension.
- **Minimalism**: We've stripped out unnecessary dependencies and components to keep KianKit lightweight. The focus is on delivering only what you need—nothing more, nothing less.
- **Eradicate Complexity**: The new auth system, alias updates, and folder structure changes are all aimed at making the development process as smooth as possible. By eliminating needless complexity, we're making sure you can focus on the essentials.

### The Process: Lessons Learned

Developing KianKit 2 wasn't without its challenges. In fact, I deleted the `v2` branch three times before getting it right. I found myself adding features and updates just because they seemed like the latest trend or because they were popular requests. But eventually, I realized that KianKit had started drifting away from its original vision. I was building something that wasn't staying true to its purpose—helping you build projects fast, without the clutter.

The lesson? Feedback is incredibly valuable, but it needs to be filtered. I had to remember that KianKit succeeded in the first place because it followed my vision of being opinionated, minimal, and easy to use. If my vision didn’t align with the feature requests, it wasn't worth adding, and trying to do so led to a more convoluted product. That's why KianKit 2 is about refocusing on what makes it truly valuable.

### What's New in 2

- **Full TypeScript Rewrite**: The entire codebase is now in TypeScript, enhancing type safety without complicating the developer experience.
- **Simplified Auth System**: Reworked authentication to use email magic link sign-ins—simple, efficient, and secure.
- **New `@/` Alias**: Introduced the `@/` alias for a cleaner, more intuitive import system.
- **Component Actions**: Added utility actions, like `autosize` for textareas, to make adding functionality straightforward and reusable.
- **SEO Enhancements**: A new `(seo)` group for essential pages ensures your project is optimized out of the box.
- **Updated Shadcn/UI Components**: Keeping the components modern and user-friendly by integrating the latest from shadcn/ui.
- **Streamlined Codebase**: Removed bloat—every part of KianKit now has a clear purpose.

### The Value for You

KianKit 2 is about realigning with what made it successful from the start: keeping things simple, efficient, and developer-friendly. The improvements in 2 are designed to help you:
