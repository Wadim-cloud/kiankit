I create new projects all the time. And, if I'm being honest, not all of them get finished—probably far fewer than I'd like to admit.

I love the thrill of building something new. But rewriting the same things I've already done dozens of times? Honestly, it's mind-numbingly boring. So, of course, I procrastinate endlessly when it comes to the boring bits—auth, sessions, databases—you know, the stuff that actually matters.

But I get it, these things are necessary. So, instead of procrastinating forever, I built KianKit. KianKit is a free, open-source SvelteKit & Supabase boilerplate that helps you build fast without the headache, while still being super extensible.

KianKit has all the essentials baked in: auth, components, theming, icons, Tailwind CSS, Supabase—you name it.

My goal with KianKit is to keep it fresh, always updating to the newest standards and adding cool new features. Once it's stable, I'll release v1 and move development to a new branch for each version—so you can always deploy from a solid, finished boilerplate instead of something half-baked.

Check out KianKit's starter page and auth demo [here](https://kit.fromkian.com). The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cowboycodr/KianKit).

And trust me, there's a lot more on the way.
