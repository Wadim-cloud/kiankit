# KianKit (v2)

This is a work-in-progress branch focused on KianKit v2. Planning on 
releasing this after Svelte 5 officially launches.

Our goal for v2 is to make the codebase easier to understand/ change. While
also updating the project to all of the latest standards. Including Svelte
5, by the time this releases.

Initially we will rewrite the codebase in TypeScript. This has been
something many users in the [r/sveltejs](https://reddit.com/r/sveltejs) subreddit have suggested. Also, in
accordance with our "simplicity first" we are switching from Supabase to
Pocketbase. Pocketbase is easier to self-host, and is praised for it's
simple API and comprehensive documentation. Lastly, we will be switching to
Svelte 5, so that users of KianKit can enjoy the many benefits of the new
update.

> Contributions/ feedback is more-than appreciated. Please create as many
issues/ pull requests as you'd like.
