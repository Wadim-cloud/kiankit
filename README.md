# KianKit (v1.1)

This is a work-in-progress branch focused on KianKit v1.1. This is a standard
update, primarily preparing the codebase for an easy Svelte 5 migration.

Also will be adding TypeScript. With Svelte, Typescript is essentially
optional. So I've decided it would be better to have it than to not.

Lastly, adding Husky and pre-configuring it to format the codebase on
commit.

In addition to preparing the codebase for Svelte 5, it also prepares
the auth for a rewrite. Currently, the auth is too complex and hard to extend.
Something which will be entirely rewritten to be more intuitive, understandable,
and modifiable in the future.

> Contributions/ feedback is more-than appreciated. Please create as many
> issues/ pull requests as you'd like.

- [x] Rewrite the codebase in TypeScript
